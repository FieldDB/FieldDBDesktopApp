# FieldDB.app

Note: at this point it is a toy (MVP!) intended to serve as a real-ish example of an Electron app. It has all the trimmings most apps will need:

* Window management
* File management (open, save, save as, dealing with modified files)
* Menus
* Keyboard shortcuts
* Passing command line parameters from the browser process to the renderer process

## Features

* Open and save files

## Developing

```bash
script/bootstrap
script/run

# To open a file from the command line
script/run path/to/corpus.json
```
